How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the intermediate stage between a working directory and the repository.
Using a flight analogy, the file is the passenger, the working directory is the city of 
departure, the staging area is the city where the passenger has a layover or catches a 
connecting flight, and the respoitory is the final destination. The repository helps
you double-check your work so you don't make unintentional commits

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

You can do that by first running 'git status' before makeing a commit. That
way you get to see what's in the staging area that you might have forgotten.
